# v4 Migration Guide

This document describes the changes made in `v4` of **NCronJob** and how to migrate from `v3`.

Version 4 of **NCronJob** introduces some breaking changes to improve the API.

## `UseNCronJob` and `UseNCronJobAsync` methods
Following the classical ASP.NET pattern, the `UseNCronJob` and `UseNCronJobAsync` methods have been introduced to the `IHost` interface. The minimal setup now looks like this:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddNCronJob(...);

var app = builder.Build();
await app.UseNCronJobAsync();
app.Run();
```

Instead of the async method `UseNCronJobAsync`, you can also use the synchronous `UseNCronJob` method. The difference is that the async method returns a `Task` that you can await.

## `RunAtStartup` method
The `RunAtStartup` method has a bit different semantics than before. All startup jobs are now executed when `UseNCronJob` or `UseNCronJobAsync` is called. This ensures that all startup jobs are completed before any other part of the application is executed.

## `AddNCronJob(Delegate)` move to `NCronJobExtensions`
The `AddNCronJob(Delegate)` (Minimal API) was a different static class than the `AddNCronJob(Action)` version. This has been fixed by moving the `AddNCronJob(Delegate)` method to the `NCronJobExtensions` class. As most developers are not invoking those extensions via the static class, this should not affect most users. Otherwise the migration is simple:

```diff
- IServiceCollection.AddNCronJob(() => {}, "* * * * *");
+ NCronJobExtensions.AddNCronJob(services, () => {}, "* * * * *");
```

##Â `IRuntimeRegistry` is more restrictive
In `v3` the `IRuntimeRegistry` offered the ability to use the whole `NCronJobOptionBuilder` which led to confusion, especially if done something like this:

```csharp
runtimeRegistry.AddJob(n => n.AddJob<MyJob>(...).RunAtStartup().AddExceptionHandler<MyHandler>());
```

It didn't make sense to add a startup job during runtime. Also adding exception handlers during runtime was out of scope for this feature. Therefore the interface is more restrictive now and only allows to add jobs.

## `IRuntimeRegistry`s `AddJob` is now called `Register`
The `AddJob` method of the `IRuntimeRegistry` has been renamed to `Register` to better reflect its purpose and to avoid the convoluted naming.

```diff
- runtimeRegistry.AddJob(r => r.AddJob);
+ runtimeRegistry.Register(r => r.AddJob);
```
