# v3 Migration Guide

This document will describe the changes made in `v3` of **NCronJob** and how to migrate from `v2`.

Version 3 of **NCronJob** brings some breaking changes to mae a better API.

### Second precision is automatically inferred
In `v2` one would define as such:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddNCronJob(
    n => n.AddJob<SimpleJob>(
        p => p.WithCronExpression("* * * * * *", true)));
```

Inside `WithCronExpression` was an optional parameter that if set to `true` the cron expression has to be in seconds precision. This was a bit confusing and not very intuitive. In `v3` the seconds precision is automatically inferred. So the above code can be simplified to:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddNCronJob(
    n => n.AddJob<SimpleJob>(
        p => p.WithCronExpression("* * * * * *")));
```
