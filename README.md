# 📣ANNOUNCEMENT📣
The library moved from `LinkDotNet.NCronJob` to just `NCronJob`!
Please uninstall the old package and install the new one. Here more about: https://github.com/NCronJob-Dev/NCronJob/discussions/66

# NCronJob

A Job Scheduler sitting on top of `IHostedService` in dotnet.

Often times one finds themself between the simplicity of the `BackgroundService`/`IHostedService` and the complexity of
a full-blown `Hangfire` or `Quartz` scheduler.
This library aims to fill that gap by providing a simple and easy to use job scheduler that can be used in any dotnet
application and feels "native".

So no need for setting up a database, just schedule your stuff right away! The library gives you two ways of scheduling
jobs:

1. Instant jobs - just run a job right away (or with a small delay; or with a given date and time)
2. Cron jobs - schedule a job using a cron expression

The whole documentation can be found here: [NCronJob Documentation](https://ncronjob-dev.github.io/NCronJob/)

## Features

- [x] The ability to schedule jobs using a cron expression
- [x] The ability to instantly run a job
- [x] Parameterized jobs - instant as well as cron jobs!
- [x] Integrated in ASP.NET - Access your DI container like you would in any other service
- [x] Get notified when a job is done (either successfully or with an error).
- [x] Retries - If a job fails, it will be retried.
- [x] The job scheduler supports TimeZones. Defaults to UTC time.
- [x] Minimal API for Jobs - implement jobs in an oneliner

## Not features

As this is a simple scheduler, some features are not included by design. If you need these features, you might want to
look into a more advanced scheduler like `Hangfire` or `Quartz`.

- [ ] Job persistence - Jobs are not persisted between restarts of the application.
- [ ] Job history - There is no history of jobs that have been run.
- [ ] Progress state - There is no way to track the progress of a job. The library will support notifying when a job is
  done, but not the progress of the job itself.

## Short example

There are two ways of defining a job.

### Minimal Job API
You can use this library in a simple one-liner:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddNCronJob((ILoggerFactory factory, TimeProvider timeProvider) =>
{
    var logger = factory.CreateLogger("My Anonymous Job");
    logger.LogInformation("Hello World - The current date and time is {Time}", timeProvider.GetLocalNow());
}, "*/5 * * * * *");
```

With this simple lambda, you can define a job that runs every 5 seconds. Pass in all dependencies, just like you would with a Minimal API.

### Via the `IJob` interface

1. Import the namespace (or let your IDE do the dirty work)

```csharp
using NCronJob;
```

2. Create a job

```csharp
public class PrintHelloWorld : IJob
{
    private readonly ILogger<PrintHelloWorld> logger;

    public PrintHelloWorld(ILogger<PrintHelloWorld> logger)
    {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    public Task RunAsync(JobExecutionContext context, CancellationToken token)
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Hello World");
        logger.LogInformation("Parameter: {Parameter}", context.Parameter);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

3. Register the NCronJob and the job in your `Program.cs`

```csharp
builder.Services.AddNCronJob(options =>
    options.AddJob<PrintHelloWorld>(j => 
    {
        // Every minute and optional parameter
        j.WithCronExpression("* * * * *")
         .WithParameter("Hello World");
    }));
```

4. Run your application and see the magic happen

## Triggering an instant job

If the need arises and you want to trigger a job instantly, you can do so:

```csharp
public class MyService
{
  private readonly IInstantJobRegistry jobRegistry;
  
  public MyService(IInstantJobRegistry jobRegistry) => this.jobRegistry = jobRegistry;

  public void MyMethod() => jobRegistry.RunInstantJob<MyJob>("I am an optional parameter");
}
```
