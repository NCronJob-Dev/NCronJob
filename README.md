# NCronJob

A Job Scheduler sitting on top of `IHostedService` in .NET.

Often, one finds themselves between the simplicity of `BackgroundService`/`IHostedService` and the complexity of
a full-blown scheduler like `Hangfire` or `Quartz`.
This library aims to fill that gap by providing a simple and easy-to-use job scheduler that can be used in any .NET
application and feels "native".

There's no need to set up a databaseâ€”just schedule your tasks right away! The library provides two ways of scheduling
jobs:

1. Instant jobs - Run a job immediately (or with a small delay, or at a specific date and time).
2. Cron jobs - Schedule a job using a cron expression.

The whole documentation can be found here: [NCronJob Documentation](https://ncronjob-dev.github.io/NCronJob/)

## Features

- [x] The ability to schedule jobs using a cron expression.
- [x] The ability to instantly run a job.
- [x] Parameterized jobs - Instant as well as cron jobs!
- [x] Integration with ASP.NET - Access your DI container like you would in any other service.
- [x] Get notified when a job is done (either successfully or with an error).
- [x] Retries - If a job fails, it will be retried.
- [x] The job scheduler supports TimeZones. Defaults to UTC time.
- [x] Minimal API for Jobs - Implement jobs in a one-liner.

## Not features

As this is a simple scheduler, some features are not included by design. If you need these features, you might want to
look into a more advanced scheduler like `Hangfire` or `Quartz`.

- [ ] Job persistence - Jobs are not persisted between restarts of the application.
- [ ] Job history - There is no history of jobs that have been run.
- [ ] Progress state - There is no way to track the progress of a job. The library supports notifying when a job is
  done, but not the progress of the job itself.

## Short example

There are two ways to define a job.

### Minimal Job API

You can use this library in a simple one-liner:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddNCronJob((ILoggerFactory factory, TimeProvider timeProvider) =>
{
    var logger = factory.CreateLogger("My Anonymous Job");
    logger.LogInformation("Hello World - The current date and time is {Time}", timeProvider.GetLocalNow());
}, "*/5 * * * * *");
```

With this simple lambda, you can define a job that runs every 5 seconds. Pass in all dependencies, just like you would with a Minimal API.

### Via the `IJob` interface

1. Import the namespace (or let your IDE do the dirty work)

```csharp
using NCronJob;
```

2. Create a job

```csharp
public class PrintHelloWorld : IJob
{
    private readonly ILogger<PrintHelloWorld> logger;

    public PrintHelloWorld(ILogger<PrintHelloWorld> logger)
    {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    public Task RunAsync(JobExecutionContext context, CancellationToken token)
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Hello World");
        logger.LogInformation("Parameter: {Parameter}", context.Parameter);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

3. Register the NCronJob and the job in your `Program.cs`

```csharp
builder.Services.AddNCronJob(options =>
    options.AddJob<PrintHelloWorld>(j => 
    {
        // Every minute and optional parameter
        j.WithCronExpression("* * * * *")
         .WithParameter("Hello World");
    }));
```

4. Run your application and see the magic happen!

## Triggering an instant job

If the need arises and you want to trigger a job instantly, you can do so:

```csharp
public class MyService
{
  private readonly IInstantJobRegistry jobRegistry;
  
  public MyService(IInstantJobRegistry jobRegistry) => this.jobRegistry = jobRegistry;

  public void MyMethod() => jobRegistry.RunInstantJob<MyJob>("I am an optional parameter");
}
```
